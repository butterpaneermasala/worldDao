# Error Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ ReferenceError: userAddress is not defined
**Problem**: GovernanceSections component was still referencing `userAddress` after switching to `useAccount` hook from wagmi.

**Solution**: Replaced all instances of `userAddress` with `address` from the `useAccount` hook:
- Permission banners now use `address` instead of `userAddress`
- Button states and conditionals updated to use `address`
- Removed `userAddress` prop from GovernanceSections component call

### 2. ✅ Contract BAD_DATA Error Prevention
**Problem**: Contract calls were failing when the voting contract wasn't deployed.

**Solution**: Added contract deployment checks before calling contract methods:
- Check if contract code exists at the address
- Gracefully handle cases where contract isn't deployed
- Better error logging for debugging

### 3. ✅ Web3Modal Integration
**Status**: Successfully integrated with proper configuration:
- WalletConnect Project ID configured
- World Chain networks defined
- Proper provider setup with fallbacks

## Current Component Architecture:

### GovernanceSections.js
- Uses `useAccount()` hook for wallet connection state
- `address` and `isConnected` from wagmi
- No longer depends on external `userAddress` prop
- Proper permission checks for NFT ownership

### Dashboard.js
- Web3Modal button integration
- Contract availability checks before interactions
- Graceful degradation when wallet not connected

### Voting.js & Bidding.js
- Web3Modal integration for wallet connections
- Connection prompts when wallet not available
- Proper error handling for voting transactions

## Environment Variables Required:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOTING_ADDRESS=contract-address
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=governance-contract-address
NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDIDATE_ADDRESS=candidate-contract-address
```

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Connect wallet using Web3Modal
3. Test governance functionality
4. Verify voting works with connected wallet
5. Check contract interactions

All major `userAddress` references have been resolved and the application should now work properly with the Web3Modal integration.
