# Contract Address Update Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Voting Contract Not Deployed Error**
**Problem**: Frontend was using old voting contract address `0x34A1D3fff3958843C43aD80F30b94c510645C316`

**Solution**: Updated to new deployed address `0x108bf94e34afa22f9b9ac3b1cb9fea618c3efa48` from recent deployment

### 2. **NFT Contract "Missing Revert Data" Errors**
**Problem**: NFT contract address was pointing to auction contract instead of NFT minter

**Solution**: 
- Updated NFT contract address from `0x5BCAEf9a3059340f39e640875fE803422b5100C8` (auction) to `0x65dc5d303ba3c97466ba1822cea33f815179d3df` (NFT minter)
- Added proper contract deployment checks in `checkNFTOwnership` function
- Improved error handling to fail gracefully instead of throwing

### 3. **Contract Deployment Verification**
**Added**: Deployment checks before making contract calls to prevent "BAD_DATA" errors
